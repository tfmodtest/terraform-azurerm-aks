## 6.0.0 (May 13, 2022)

The goal of v5.0.0 is to add a GitHub Action-based CI pipeline and introduce modern acceptance tests to ensure that future pull requests to this module meet our new standard for AzureRM modules. 

The Module code of v5.0.0 is exactly the same as v4.16.0. Users who use v4.16.0 can directly upgrade to v5 without worrying about changes. We promise not to modify Module code in v5 version.
